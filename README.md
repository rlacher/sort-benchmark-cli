# Sorting Algorithm Benchmark

This project compares the performance of various sorting algorithms. The algorithms are implemented in Java.

## Purpose

The goal is to analyse and visualise the efficiency of different common sorting algorithms under various conditions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the respository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/rlacher/sort-algorithms.git
	```

2. Execute the application

	```bash
	gradle run
	```

3. Instructions on how to configure the analysis will follow
